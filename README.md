# Fraud-Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraud transaction that can harm company profits. with machine learning, we can detect fraud transactions to prevent any fraud transaction in the future

## Dataset
- Data source : Kaggle

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
- Modeling Tools: ADABoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regressor

## Data Preprocessing
- Fill Missing Value(If needed)
- Handle duplicate Data
- Handle Anomaly Data
- Handle Data Imbalance with SMOTE and undersampling. Compare them both and mention which one is the best for this dataset
- Convert Categorical Value into numerical value
- Feature engineering
- Feature Selection with correlation matrix

## Model Development

### ADABoost
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimal parameters (max depth, learning rate, sub samble, etc) selected based on Baynessian Opt.

### Random Forest
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employed Bayesian optimization to fine-tune parameters such as tree depth and number of estimators.

### Logistic Regressor

## Model Evaluation & Comparison
- Evaluation metrics: F1 Score, Precision, Recall
